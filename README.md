# Real-Time-Data-Pipeline-for-News-API-with-Kafka-Cassandra-and-Apache-Airflow
This project builds a real-time data pipeline that streams news data from the News API into Kafka, and then stores it in Cassandra for efficient and scalable storage. Apache Airflow is used for orchestration, managing the entire pipeline to ensure smooth, real-time data processing and up-to-date news delivery.
